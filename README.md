# ui-components

First attempt in creating custom module packages with Github packages.

Github package is an interesting tool and it is great to have this option locally on github. Downsides, it is very new and there is no much discussion on it on the web,  also, doesn't support pnpm or yarn, atm, I can only install modules using npm.

The docs are good but they could be better, seems possible to set up a monorepo but is not so clear how at least I didn't find it clear.

Every time I have to publish a package I need to specify the package path and also change the version manually.
It might be possible to automate the process with github actions. 

However there are more mature tools out there so, because it is my first attempt in creating a monorepo, I'll go for a different tool. 

Maybe Lerna.
